## Electro-chemicallaly_motivated flow model:

✔ Linear Regression --> for basic data fitting but low precision for higher values
✔ Decision Trees --> prone to overfitting
✔ Random Forests --> Robust against overfitting
✔ Support Vector Machines --> Can be used but not ideal for experimental data 
✔ ANN --> not ideal for small datasets
